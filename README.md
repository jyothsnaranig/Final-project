📊 Fleetcor: Cross-Sell Early Account Monitoring
Executive Summary
The Cross-Sell Early Account Monitoring Project focuses on evaluating the performance of customers who transitioned from the Fuel-Only Card to the Universal Card under Fleetcor’s Cross-Sell Program.

The primary objective is to identify early signs of risk and analyze behavioral trends post-transition. Through in-depth monitoring and data-driven analysis, the project aims to determine:

Whether these accounts show emerging signs of financial or usage-related risk

The effectiveness of the cross-sell strategy

Recommendations for timely risk mitigation measures

This initiative supports data-backed decision-making, enabling Fleetcor to enhance customer lifecycle management and reduce potential write-offs while optimizing their cross-sell strategies.
